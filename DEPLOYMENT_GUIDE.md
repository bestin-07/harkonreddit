2. Run `railway-build.sh` to download spaCy models
3. Set up the environment automatically

No manual installation needed! ðŸŽ‰

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables in Railway
1. In your Railway project dashboard, go to the **"Variables"** tab
2. Add the following environment variables:

   **Required Variables:**
   ```
   SECRET_KEY = your-very-secure-secret-key-here
   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID = your_reddit_client_id  
   REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET = your_reddit_client_secret
   REDDIT_USER_AGENT = StockHark/1.0 by YourRedditUsername
   ```
   
   **Optional Variables:**
   ```
   STOCKHARK_COLLECTION_INTERVAL = 30

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Your App

### Check Application Status
```bash
cd ~/stockhark
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "
from src.stockhark.core.data import get_database_stats
stats = get_database_stats()
print(f'ðŸ“Š Total mentions: {stats[\"total_mentions\"]}')
print(f'ðŸŽ¯ Unique stocks: {stats[\"unique_stocks\"]}') 
print(f'ðŸ’¾ Database size: {stats[\"database_size_mb\"]:.2f} MB')
"
```

### Update Your Application
