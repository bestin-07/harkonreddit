## üìä How It Works

### 1. Reddit Monitoring
- Fetches hot posts from financial subreddits
- Extracts stock symbols using regex patterns
- Collects post metadata (score, comments, timestamps)

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Uses TextBlob for basic sentiment analysis
- Enhances with custom keyword analysis
- Bullish keywords: "buy", "long", "moon", "rocket"
- Bearish keywords: "sell", "short", "crash", "dump"

### 3. Alert System
- Triggers when stocks meet criteria:
  - 10+ mentions in 1 hour
  - Sentiment score > ¬±0.3
  - Multiple unique posts
- Sends styled HTML emails to subscribers

### 4. Data Storage
- SQLite database with two main tables:
  - `subscribers`: Email addresses
  - `stock_data`: Mentions, sentiment, timestamps

## üé® Design Philosophy

### Color Theory
- **Primary**: `#667eea` - Modern blue-purple gradient
- **Secondary**: `#764ba2` - Complementary purple
- **Success/Bullish**: `#38a169` - Positive green
- **Error/Bearish**: `#e53e3e` - Alert red
- **Neutral**: `#718096` - Balanced gray

### UI/UX Principles
- **Minimalistic**: Clean, uncluttered interface
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach
- **Accessible**: High contrast ratios and clear typography
- **Fast**: Optimized loading and smooth animations
